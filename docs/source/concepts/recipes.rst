Recipes
@@@@@@@

A *Recipe* is not a class. It is a term defined to differentiate between a
specialized CategoricalVariant and a general CategoricalVariant. These
recipes are pre-defined CategoricalVariants with specific constraints
that represent standard categorical variants that have been identified
in variant knowledgebases and registries. Implementers are encouraged
to use the recipes that exist whenever possible, but are free to create
new recipes as needed in a given implementation. New recipes should be
shared with the community on the |catvrs_discussion| board.
